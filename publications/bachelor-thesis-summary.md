## Abstract 

Cannabidiol supplements (CBD) are increasingly consumed by athletes to improve regeneration. However, the evidence for the pro-regenerative effects of CBD in sports is quite limited. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects of a single CBD supplementation in a six-arm placebo-controlled crossover study after resistance training on performance and muscle damage. Before and after the resistance training, one-repetition maximum in the back squat (1RM BS), countermovement jump (CMJ), and blood serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin (Myo) were measured in healthy, well-trained participants. 16 out of 21 participants completed the study and were included in the analysis. In 1RM BS, a significant decrease was observed after 24 h (p < 0.01) but not after 48 and 72 h. A significant group difference was detected after 72 h (p < 0.05; ES = 0.371). In CMJ, no significant changes were observed. The CK and Myo concentrations increased significantly after 24 h (CK: p < 0.001; Myo: p < 0.01), 48 h (CK: p < 0.001; Myo: p < 0.01) and 72 h (CK: p < 0.001; Myo: p < 0.001). After 72 h, significant group differences were observed for both muscle damage biomarkers (CK: p < 0.05 ES = 0.24; Myo: p < 0.05; ES = 0.21). The results show small but significant effects on muscle damage and recovery of squat performance after 72 h. However, more data are required for clearer statements concerning potential pro-regenerative effects of CBD supplementation after resistance training.
