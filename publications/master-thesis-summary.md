## Abstract 

Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) supplements are increasingly consumed by athletes to reduce pain during exercise. However, evidence of pain-relieving effects of CBD in healthy participants is limited. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the effects of chronic CBD supplementation on perceived pain and performance during cycling exercise. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design, 22 healthy participants completed two separated, 10-minute maximal effort time trials on the watt bike, with a 3-week supplementation period in-between. During exercise, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and blood lactate (BLa) were measured every 2 minutes. Additionally, distance covered, average power, and peak power from the pre- and post-test were recorded. Results: No differences were observed between the CBD and placebo group (p > 0.05) or between overall pre- and post-test (p > 0.05) in any of the variables. RPE, HR, and BLa increased significantly (p < 0.001), and average power decreased significantly (p < 0.001) over the duration of the cycling exercise in similar amounts in both groups in the pre- and the post-test. Conclusion: 3-weeks of CBD supplementation does not reduce RPE and does not improve cycling time-trial performance in healthy male and female participants.
